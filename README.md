# whatsapp-web

A simple shell script that runs WhatsApp Web and a tray icon.

I created this because I needed an alternative after the Whatsie project was abandoned.


## Dependencies
This project uses:

* chromium-browser - to run WhatsApp web
* [yad](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/yad.1.html) - to create the tray icon


## Usage
Make sure the script is on your path. I like to alias it as `whatsapp`.
